# Interactive MNIST Paint GUI

This is a PoC of using Keras to build, train, save and put in into production a model.
I'm just beginning with Machine Learning so probably this is not the best model.

The interface offers a canvas square to draw numbers in and gives the predicted number within the scores for the rest of numbers.

## Requirements installation
- Pyhton 3
- Tkinter: `sudo apt install python3-tk`
- Tensorflows: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux
- Keras, Matploitlib, numpy: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


## Running
Clone this repository and move there:
`git clone https://github.com/salvacorts/Keras-MNIST-Paint.git && cd Keras-MNIST-Paint`

Run the program:
`chmod +x main.py && ./main.py`


## Hacking
Although this project comes with a pre-trained model, modifying and running [modules/train.py](https://github.com/salvacorts/Keras-MNIST-Paint/blob/master/modules/train.py) you can train your own model and tweak this Neural Network.
